# Tomorrow Night Paradise

A light-on-dark Emacs theme which is essentially a tweaked version of Chris
Kempson's [Tomorrow Night Bright][tomorrow] theme.

Particularly colors have been adjusted to look right in a xterm-256color
terminal. Additionally window borders have been given a more minimal look and
face definitions have been added for various packages I use on a daily basis.
